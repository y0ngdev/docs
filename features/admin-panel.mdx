## 👨‍💻 Creating an Admin User

Admins are regular users with elevated privileges that allow them to manage the platform through the admin dashboard. You can create one using the built-in Artisan command.

### 1. Run the Command

Open your terminal and execute:

```bash
php artisan add:admin
````

You will be prompted to enter:

* **Name**
* **Email**
* **Password**

Once completed, you'll see:

```text
Admin user 'test@example.com' created successfully.
```

## 🚪 Accessing the Admin Panel

After the admin user is created, simply log in to the site with their credentials.

If the user has admin privileges, the **Admin Panel** link will appear in the navbar. You can also access it directly via:

```url
https://your-domain.com/admin
```
