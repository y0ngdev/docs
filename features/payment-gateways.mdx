title: "Payment Gateways"
---

MasteringX currently supports **Stripe** as the sole payment gateway for handling payments.

> ⚠️ Payment processors can be configured through:  
> - The `.env` configuration file  
> - **Admin Dashboard → Settings → Payment Processors**

## Stripe Integration

You can enable and manage Stripe in two ways:

###  Using the `.env` File

Add the following variables to your `.env` file:

```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
````

Be sure to replace the placeholders with your actual Stripe credentials, which are available from your [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/).

---

###  Using the Admin Dashboard

You can also enable and configure Stripe directly in the admin panel:

**Admin Dashboard → Settings → Payment Processors**

Changes made through the dashboard are applied instantly.

<Warning>
If you make use of docker, editing from the dashboard fails cos the `.env` file isn't added to the container for security measures.
</Warning>
---

###  Clearing the Configuration Cache

If you make changes via the `.env` file, don’t forget to clear the configuration cache to apply them:

```bash
php colibri cache:clear
```
