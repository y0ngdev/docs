A **module** is a group of related lessons under a single theme or section of your course.

Your course is made up of **modules**, and each module contains one or more **lessons**. Think of modules like *chapters in a book*, and lessons as the *pages within those chapters*.


For example:

* **Module 1: Introduction to PostgreSQL**

    * Lesson 1: What is PostgreSQL?
    * Lesson 2: Installing PostgreSQL
* **Module 2: SQL Basics**

    * Lesson 1: SELECT statements
    * Lesson 2: Filtering with WHERE
