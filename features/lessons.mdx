Each **lesson** is an individual unit of learning. Lessons usually include a video, but they can also have accompanying text, code samples, or resource links.


<Warning>
 **Important**: 

Make sure your server has **FFmpeg** installed and that the **queue worker is running**. Uploaded videos are processed in the background using a queue job. If either FFmpeg or your queue is not active, videos will not be processed or streamable.

### How to Add a Lesson

To add a lesson :




1. In the **Admin Panel**, navigate to the **Lessons** page or go directly to:
   `https://your-domain.com/admin/lessons`

2. Click on the **“New Lesson”** button at the top right.

3. Fill in the lesson details:

   * `Title` – e.g., *“Writing Your First SQL Query”*

   *  `Slug` – auto-generated from the title, but you can edit it if you prefer a custom URL.

   * `Module` – select the module you want this lesson to belong to.

   * `Postion` – required and must be unique within the module. This determines the order in which lessons are displayed.

   * `Lesson Summary`  – supports Markdown; use this to describe what the lesson covers or any important notes.

   * `Video`  – upload a video file. *Currently, only uploads to the `private` disk are supported.*

   * `Duration` – optional. If present in the video’s metadata, FFMpeg will automatically extract and display it.

   * `Free preview` – required. Choose whether this lesson is available for free preview or restricted behind a paywall.

   * `Published` – required. Determines whether the lesson is visible to learners on the frontend.

4. Click **“Create”** to save the lesson.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Ensure your uploaded video has proper metadata. The system relies on this to detect video duration and perform video processing with FFMpeg.
