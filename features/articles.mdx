In addition to video courses, your platform also supports long-form written content in the form of **articles**.
Articles are perfect for publishing tutorials, announcements, blog posts, or deep dives that complement your video
lessons.

4. Fill in the article details:

    * `Title` – The article’s headline. Displayed in article listings and browser tabs.
