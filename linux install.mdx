we've decided to make installing MasteringX  as simple as possible.
All you need to do is run a single install command and  it will automatically:

-  Install all required system packages
-  Set up PHP, MySQL, Node.js, Composer, and FFmpeg
-  Configure the environment and build frontend assets
-  Deploy the application


> ⚠️ Note:
To ensure long-term stability and compatibility, we recommend beginning with a clean Linux installation like Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

Make the script executable by running the command below install the project root:

```bash
chmod +x install.sh

chmod +x deploy/bare/*.sh

```
Following that,  run the command below, then sit back and let the installation complete.

```bash
./install.sh
```
