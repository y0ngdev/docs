**MasteringX is a Laravel powered full-stack web application, designed primarily for Linux environments.**

To run MasteringX efficiently, you will either a VPS or VDS server. This is due to its reliance on an extensive set of
backend services.

It is not a lightweight script that can run on shared hosting; rather, it is a modern web app designed for performance
and versatility.


<Warning>

</Warning>

## Requirements

Before installing the software, please make sure your server meets the requirements below.

<Tip>
If you plan to use **Docker**, you can skip the section as it already fulfil the requirements listed below.
</Tip>

- PHP 8.3+
- Apache/Nginx
- MySQL 8.0+ or any relational database like PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.
- Node.js 20.x+
- Composer
- NPM

## Installation

Once you download the masteringx archive, you will see the following directories:

```
masteringx/
├── docs/
├── src/
```

Inside the `src` directory, you will see the all source code and files of Masteringx.
Upload all files from `src` directory to the root directory of the server where you want to install Masteringx.

#### Copy .env file

To get started, you have to copy `.env.example` file to `.env` and edit the file.

```bash
# Go to the root directory of your  application
cd /path/to/your/masteringx

cp .env.example .env
```

Ensure you edit the file to match your servers environment variables.

#### FS Permissions

MasteringX requires some permissions to be set for the storage and public directories.

```bash
# Set the correct permissions for the storage and public directories
sudo chown -R $USER:www-data .
chmod -R ug+rwx storage bootstrap/cache
```

To install this application, you have two options which we would go over below.

### Option 1: Install using Docker

The application comes with a Docker compose configuration for easy deployment. To use this option, ensure that you have
docker installed install your server.

To verify your installation, run the command below:

```bash Terminal
docker --version
docker compose --version
```

If the above command returns error, you can following the installation instruction on
this [site](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

The only everything you need to do is to run the command below and let docker do it's magic:

```bash Terminal
docker compose up -d  --build
```
It will take a while to build the containers, because it will install all the dependencies and compile the assets.


Next, run this command to sh into the container:
```bash Terminal
docker exec -it masteringx-php-fpm bash
```

And run this to generate the app key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate --show
```
Copy and paste the outputted value into the `APP_KEY` variable in your `.env` file.

Down the container
```bash
docker compose down
```
and restart it.
```bash
docker compose -d up
```
From now on, you only need to run this command.


If everything is done correctly, you should see message about successful build and running of the containers.

### Option 2: Install on  Linux Server

<Note>
 ⚠️ Note:

To ensure long-term stability and compatibility, we recommend beginning with a clean Linux installation like Ubuntu
22.04 LTS.
</Note>

#### Server Configurations

For the application to run smoothly on the fresh installation, some system packages and PHP extensions needs to be
installed. Run the commands below to install these packages on your server:

##### copy from your docker file

```bash Terminal
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common \
    apt-utils \
    libpq-dev \
    libpng-dev \
    openssl \
    libjpeg-dev \
    libfreetype6-dev \
    libwebp-dev \
    libxpm-dev \
    libgd-dev \
    libzip-dev \
    libicu-dev \
    zip \
    unzip \
    git \
    libonig-dev \
    libxml2-dev \
    libsqlite3-dev \
    libssl-dev \
    curl
```

After the installation is complete, although this might take a while. rRun the command below to install the PHP
extensions

```bash Terminal
# Install PHP and basic extensions
sudo apt-get install php php-cli php-fpm php-mysql php-gd php-intl \
php-mbstring php-zip php-bcmath php-opcache php-curl php-xml php-posix php-fileinfo

```

Following that, enable the extensions in your `php.ini` file:

```ini php.ini
extension=gd
extension=intl
extension=mbstring
extension=pdo_mysql
extension=mysqli
extension=bcmath
extension=pcntl
extension=zip
extension=opcache
extension=posix
extension=file-info
```

<Tip>
 Ensure that there are no duplicates, as some extensions may have been enabled.
</Tip>
Verify that the extension have been installed and properly configured by running:

```bash Terminal
php -m | grep -E "(gd|intl|mbstring|pdo_mysql|mysqli|bcmath|pcntl|zip|opcache|file-info|posix)"
```

This should list all the required extensions if properly installed.

#### Install Dependencies

Now you have to install two types of dependencies, first is PHP dependencies and second is CSS/JS/Node.js dependencies.

Since you already have PHP installed with composer, you can just run the following command to install PHP dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

Once you see a success message from Composer installation, let's install Node.js dependencies.

```bash
npm ci
```

#### Generate App key


```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

If everything is done right, all PHP and NodeJS dependencies will be installed successfully and we can move to the next
step.

#### Database Configuration

Now, we are ready to configure the DB for your application. Do the following steps:

Open the .env file and edit the following variables:

```env .env
# or any other database you want to use
DB_CONNECTION=mysql

# or your database host
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1

# or your database port
DB_PORT=3306

# or your database name
DB_DATABASE=masteringx

# replace with your database username
DB_USERNAME=masteringx_user

# replace with your database password
DB_PASSWORD=supersecurepassword
```

The next step is to run the migrations and link the storage directory. Run the following command:

```bash
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan db:seed
php artisan storage:link
```

If the database does not exist yet, the CLI may prompt you to create it automatically. Confirm with `Y` and hit `enter`.

These commands will create the database tables and seed the database with the default data.

If all previous steps are completed right, we must move to the next step - building frontend.

Since masteringx frontend is built with VueJS and TailwindCSS, we use Vite for building frontend. So, you need to run
the following command to build the frontend:

```bash
npm run build
```

If everything runs correctly, all frontend assets will be built and stored in the `public/` directory.

#### HTTP Server

ColibriPlus allows you to use any HTTP server you want to use. But, we recommend you to use Nginx for production
environment. And the documentation below is for Nginx.

Nginx configuration
<Warning>
WARNING

✋✋✋✋✋

Attention! At this stage, your nginx server must be running and listening on port 443. As we are using SSL, you must
have a valid SSL certificate for your domain. You can use Let's Encrypt for free.

This guide does not cover the HTTP server setup, SSL certificate setup, or any other server tools. If you are not
familiar with these tools, please consider using our installation service. You can contact me via My website.
</Warning>
You can find the Nginx configuration file example in `docker/prod/nginx/conf.d/nginx.conf` file.

Please note that your Nginx root must root must point to the public directory of your application not the root directory
itself.

You can add or change server block for your needs if you know what you are doing.

```conf
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name www.your-domain.com your-domain.com;
    root /path/to/masteringx/public;
	client_max_body_size 4G;

  
  proxy_buffer_size    64k;
  proxy_buffers     16 32k;
  proxy_busy_buffers_size 64k;
  proxy_temp_file_write_size 64k;
  proxy_pass_header Set-Cookie;
  proxy_redirect     off;
  proxy_hide_header  Vary;
  proxy_set_header   Accept-Encoding '';
  proxy_ignore_headers Cache-Control Expires;
  proxy_set_header   Referer $http_referer;
  proxy_set_header   Host   $host;
  proxy_set_header   Cookie $http_cookie;
  proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP  $remote_addr;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Server $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  # 2 hours timeout

  send_timeout 7200s;

  add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
  add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
  add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";

  index index.html index.htm index.php;

  charset utf-8;

  location / {
		try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
	}

	location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
	location = /robots.txt  { access_log off; log_not_found off; }

	error_page 404 /index.php;

	location ~ \.php$ {
		try_files $uri =404;
		fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
		fastcgi_pass php-fpm:9000;
		fastcgi_index index.php;
		include fastcgi_params;
		fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
		fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
		fastcgi_read_timeout 240;
	}

	location ~* \.(jpg|jpeg|gif|png|css|js|ico|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|otf|eot|ttf|ttc|map|mp4|webm|ogg|ogv|webp|zip|rar|tar|gz|bz2|7z)$ {

	    try_files $uri /index.php?$query_string;
		expires max;
		log_not_found off;
	}
}

```

After you have added the server block to your nginx configuration file, you can test your configuration by running the
following command:

```bash
nginx -t
```

If you get no errors, you can restart your nginx server by running the following commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl restart php-fpm
```

And finally, to optimize your application, you can run the following commands:

```bash
php artisan optimize
php artisan filament:optimize
```
