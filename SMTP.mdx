<Warning>
 ðŸš¨ Important

 **Warning**: If SMTP is not properly configured, your users **wonâ€™t receive account credentials after payment**.  
 This is especially critical since registration happens *after* successful payment via Stripe.
</Warning>

MasteringX uses Laravelâ€™s mail system to send out important emails such as:

[//]: # (- Course purchase receipts)
- Password reset links
- Welcome emails after payment
- Any other future notifications

To ensure emails are delivered successfully, you must configure **SMTP settings** in your `.env` file.

##  Setting Up SMTP

Open the `.env` file in the root directory of your MasteringX installation and update the mail section with your SMTP credentials:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_SCHEME=https
MAIL_HOST=smtp.yourdomain.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@yourdomain.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-email-password
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your-email@yourdomain.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Your Site's Name"
```

TIP:

After updating the `.env` file, you may need to clear the configuration cache by running:

```bash
php artisan config:clear
```
</Note>

## Testing SMTP

After configuring your SMTP settings in the `.env` file, you can verify that email delivery works by using the built-in Artisan command provided by MasteringX.

###  Usage

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
php artisan mail:test your-email@example.com
```

Replace `your-email@example.com` with the address you want to test with.

### âœ… What It Does

- Sends a plain text email to the specified address.
- Uses your current `.env` mail configuration.
- Reports success or failure directly in the terminal.

If the command completes successfully, check the inbox of the provided email address. If no message arrives, review your `.env` values for any mistakes (e.g., wrong host, port, or credentials).
